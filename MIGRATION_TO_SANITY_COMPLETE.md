# Migration to Sanity CMS - Complete ✅

## Summary

Successfully migrated the Limer Properties website from dummy/mock data to live Sanity CMS integration!

## What Changed

### 🏠 Home Page (`app/page.tsx`)

- ✅ Now fetches real properties from Sanity using `useSanityProperties()`
- ✅ Fetches filter options using `useSanityFilters()`
- ✅ Uses `useSanityPropertyFilter()` for client-side filtering
- ✅ Shows loading states with spinner while fetching data
- ✅ Featured properties pulled from Sanity (where `isFeatured: true`)
- ✅ Changed property keys from `property.id` to `property._id`

### 🏘️ Properties Page (`app/properties/page.tsx`)

- ✅ Now fetches real properties from Sanity

### 🏡 Property Card (`component/PropertyCard/index.tsx`)

- ✅ Updated to use `SanityProperty` type instead of old `Property` type
- ✅ Now uses Sanity Image URL builder (`urlFor()`) for optimized images
- ✅ Fixed references to use Sanity structure:
  - `property.type` → `property.propertyType.slug.current`
  - `property.location` → `property.location.name`
  - `property.city` → `property.location.city.name`
  - `property.id` → `property.slug.current`
  - `property.images[0]` → `urlFor(property.images[0].asset)`
- ✅ Handles optional fields (bedrooms, bathrooms, area)
- ✅ Links to property details using slug

### 📄 Property Details Page (`app/property/[id]/page.tsx`)

- ✅ Completely rewritten to fetch individual property from Sanity
- ✅ Uses slug-based routing (e.g., `/property/luxury-5-bedroom-duplex`)
- ✅ Fetches property data on mount using GROQ query

- ✅ Displays 404 page if property not found
- ✅ Uses Sanity Image URL builder for gallery images
- ✅ Shows all Sanity property fields:
  - Structure (Bungalow, Duplex, etc.)
  - Floors
  - **Floor Position** (NEW! - shows which floor a flat is on)
  - Year Built
  - Parking spaces
  - Furnished status
  - Features & Amenities
- ✅ Image gallery with thumbnails
- ✅ Breadcrumb navigation updated

### 🎛️ Filter Bar (`component/FilterBar/index.tsx`)

- ✅ Updated to accept `string` types instead of old `PropertyType` enum
- ✅ Property type slugs updated to match Sanity schema:
  - `house-sale` → `house-for-sale`
  - `house-rent` → `house-for-rent`
- ✅ Location filter now uses Sanity location slugs

## New Features Included

### Floor Position Field

Added support for the new `floorPosition` field, which shows which floor a flat/apartment is located on:

- Ground Floor (0)
- 3rd Floor
- 10th Floor
- etc.

This helps users know exactly where in a building the property is located!

## Data Flow

### Before (Mock Data)

```
properties.ts (hardcoded) → Components → Display
```

### After (Sanity CMS)

```
Sanity Studio → Sanity API → React Hooks → Components → Display
```

## How to Use

### 1. Add Data in Sanity Studio

Go to `http://localhost:3000/studio` and:

1. Create Cities & States
2. Create Property Types & Structures
3. Create Locations
4. Add Properties with images

### 2. View on Website

- **Home Page**: Featured properties + all properties with basic filtering
- **Properties Page**: Full property catalog with advanced filtering
- **Property Details**: Click "View Details" on any property card

## Technical Details

### Hooks Used

- `useSanityProperties()` - Fetches all properties
- `useSanityFilters()` - Fetches filter options (locations, types, structures)
- `useSanityPropertyFilter()` - Client-side filtering of Sanity properties

### Image Optimization

All images are optimized using Sanity's CDN via `urlFor()`:

```typescript
urlFor(image.asset).width(600).height(400).url();
```

### Routing

Property details pages use slug-based routing:

- Old: `/property/prop-1`
- New: `/property/luxury-5-bedroom-duplex`

## What's Next

1. ✅ Dummy data removed - site now powered by Sanity
2. ⏳ Next step: Add actual properties in Sanity Studio
3. ⏳ Test filtering and search functionality
4. ⏳ Optimize images and performance
5. ⏳ Add more seed data if needed
